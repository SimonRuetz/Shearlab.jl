### Notes on presentation: Tomographic Reconstruction and Wavefront set.

# Slide 1: Presentation.

- Contributions by Philipp, Gitta and Ozan.

# Slide 2: Slide 3 and 4.

- Show the forward model, and mention that g is known as the sinogram in this parametrization. And what you mean by distributions (dual of smooth distributions).

- Ill posedness of the problem: Filtered back projection, involves differnetaion, incresies singularities and noise. Filtered back projection is unbounded, two far apart images can have very close Radon transform.

# Slide 5: Solving inverse problems.

- Classical approach when it is not straight forward to compute the inverse. Missfit against data, minimizing an affince transform of the negative loglikelihood. Best probabilistic estimator. Typicially use the Square error.
