## Details to improve in the Canonical Transform.

- Theory of continuous compactly supported shearlet frames (there is just discrete version by now), or create the periodic compactly supported system in a discrete setting.

- Go deeper into the details of regularity on the elements of the system, mostly of the ones that intersect the boundary and see how it gets affected by the subspace orthogonal projection. And see if it is in schwartz and sobolev spaces.

- Wavefront set resolution theorems for the sobolev and schwartz subspaces.
