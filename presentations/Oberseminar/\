\title{Notes: Canonical Transform}
\author{HÃ©ctor Andrade Loarca}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this notes we present the canonical shearlet transform associated to the space of the two dimensional tomography. The main reason of this construction is the characterization of the Wavefront set of the sinogram of a tomographic image by studying the decay rate of its shearlet coefficients, which at the same time characterizes the Wavefront set of the original image.

\subsection*{Two dimensional electron tomography}

Tomography is a process of imaging by sections or sectioning of a speciment of interest, through the use of any kind of penetrating wave. This method is used in radiology, archaeology, biology, geophysics, materials science, and other areas of science. In many cases the production of the images based on tomography arise after solving an inverse problem, known as tomographic reconstruction, generally ill-posed. 

\bigskip

There exist different methods of tomography acquisition, in this work we will study the measurment setting associated with the so called X-ray transform (or parallel beam transform), that measures the attenuation coefficient of an specimen $f\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ by the values of its integral along different straight lines. In two dimensions the X-ray transform coincides with the Radon transform.

\begin{definition}[Radon Transform]
\label{Radondef}
Let $f\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$, $\theta\in [0,2\pi)$ and $s\in\mathbb{R}$ then the Radon transform of $f$ along the line $L(\theta,s) = \{ (x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2 : x cos\theta + y \sin\theta = s\}$ is given by the integral
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Radoneq1}
\mathcal{R}f (L)=\mathcal{R}f(\theta,s)=\iint_{(x,y)\in L} f(x,y)dS = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x,y) \delta (x\cos\theta+y\sin\theta-s)dxdy
\end{equation}
to this definition of Radon transform we refer as the sinogram and is the one we are gonna focus on. Although one could also use the next definition
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Radoneq2}
\mathcal{R}  f(u,s) := \int_{x_2\in\mathbb{R}} f(u-sx_2,x_2)dx_2
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

In Figure~\ref{fig:Sheep-Logan-Phantom} one can see the Sheep-Logan phantom, which is a standard test image, that serves as the model of a human head in the developing and testing of image reconstruction algorithms. Figure~\ref{fig:Sheep-Logan-Phantom-Measured} show the measured lines of the phantom used for the Radon transform, and finally in Figure~\ref{fig:Sinogram} one can finally see the sinogram o Radon transform of the phatom.

As one can see the sinogram and the original picture are form of singularities of different types. This problem is ill-posed since its associated inverse (Filtered Back Projection) is unbounded, so one would need to perform a regularization method and this extra information can play and important role when trying to regularize. The concepts of singularity and regularity can be generalized to all distributions, the theory behind this is known as microlocal regularity theory. 

\subsection*{Microlocal regularity}

\begin{definition}[$N$-regular point and $N$-regular directed point]
Let $N\in\mathbb{R}$ and $f$ a distribution on $\mathbb{R}^2$. We say that $x\in\mathbb{R}^2$ is a $N-$regular point if there exists a neighbourhood $U_x$ of $x$ such that $\Phi \psi\in C^N$, where $\Phi$ is a smooth cutoff function with $\Phi\equiv 1$ on $U_x$. 

Furthermore we call $(x,\lambda)$ and $N$-regular directed point if there exists a neighbourhood $U_x$ of $x$, a smooth cutoff function $\Phi$ with $\Phi\equiv 1$ on $U_x$ and a neighbourhood $V_{\lambda}$ of $\lambda$ such that

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:N-reg-direc}
(\Phi f)^{\wedge}(\eta)=O((1-|\eta|)^{-N}) \quad\text{for all}\quad \eta=(\eta_1,\eta_2)\quad \text{such that}\quad \frac{\eta_2}{\eta_1}\in V_{\lambda}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\bigskip

The $N-$Wavefront Set $WF^N(f)$ is defined as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:N-wavefront-set}
WF^N(f):=\{(x,\lambda)\in \mathbb{R}^2\times(\mathbb{R}^2\setminus\{0\}): (x,\lambda)\quad \text{is not a $N-$regular directed point of f}\}
\end{equation}

\textbf{The Wavefront Set} $WF(f)$ is defined as 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Wavefront-set}
WF(f)=\cup_{N>0}WF^N(f)
\end{equation}

Notice that if $(x,\lambda)\in WF(f)$ then $x$ is a singular point of $f$, then the Wavefront Set ha the information of the singular domain of $f$ and the direction to where the singularities move. The directional information that one can extract using the Radon transform, can be used to characterize the Wavefront Set of a function, this using the definition at equation~\ref{eq:Radoneq2}.

\begin{theorem}[Projection Slice Theorem]
\label{thm:proj-slice}
Let $f$ be a tempered distribution, then
$$
(\mathcal{R}f(u,s))^{\wedge}(\omega)=\hat{f}(w(1,s))
$$
Therefore, $(x,\lambda)$ is an $N-$regular directed point is that
$$
(\mathcal{R}\Phi f(u,s))^{\wedge}(\omega)=O(|\omega|^{-N}) \quad \text{and}\quad s\in V_{\lambda}
$$
\end{theorem}

In \cite{Ozan-tomography} Ozan \"Otkem, et al.\ presented a relation between the $N-$Wavefront Set of a function and the $(N+1/2)-$Wavefront Set of its Radon transform. Also, in \cite{WaveFrontSetGrohs} Philipp Grohs presented a method of Wavefront Set Resolution using Continuous Shearlet Frames. The next is our goal:

\bigskip

\textbf{We want to transfer the information of the Wavefront set of a function using Shearlet Frames, when we just know its Radon transform.}


\subsection*{Shearlets in Sinogram Space}

As one can refer to Equation~\ref{eq:Radoneq1}, the Radon transform of a function $\mathcal{R}f(x_1,x_2)$, where $(x_1,x_2)\in [0,2\pi)\times \mathbb{R}$ and it is $2\pi$-periodic in the $x_1$-direction, so in order to be able to use Shearlet Frames in the Radon Transform of a function, we would need first to construct a Shearlet Transform on $L^2_{2\pi-x_1}([0,2\pi)\times \mathbb{R})$ of square integrable functions on $[0,2\pi)\times \mathbb{R}$ that are also $2\pi$-periodic in $x_1$-direction. 
\bigskip 

We recall that given $(a,s,t)\in\mathbb{R}_{+}\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^2$, the classical shearlet transform of a function $f\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ associated to the generating function $\psi\in L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ is given by 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:class_shear}
\langle f, \psi_{a,s,t}\rangle = \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} f(x)\overline{\psi_{a,s,t}(x)}dx
\end{equation}

where the shearlet system is given by

$$
\mathcal{SH}(\psi)=\{\psi_{a,s,t}(x):=a^{-3/4}\psi(S_sA_ax-t):(a,s,t)\in\mathbb{R}_+\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^2\}
$$

and the scaling matrix $A_a$ and shearing matrix $S_s$ are given by

$$
A_a := \left( \begin{matrix} a & 0 \\ 0 & a^{1/2}\end{matrix}\right), \quad S_s := \left(\begin{matrix} 1 & s \\ 0 & 1 \end{matrix}\right)
$$

Under some conditions on the generating function $\psi$, like the case of \textbf{\textit{classical shearlets}} \cite[p.~19]{ShearletsGitta}, the shearlet system will form a frame , in some cases (band-limited shearlets) one has even tight frames.

\bigskip

Our approach will be based on the so called \textbf{\textit{cone-adapted shearlet system}} generated by three functions $\phi,\psi,\tilde{\psi}\in L^ 2(\mathbb{R}^2)$, parameters $(a,s,t)\in\mathbb{R}_{+}\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^2$, the corresponding scaling and shearing matrices $A_a$ and $S_s$ and a sampling matrix $M_c=\text{diag}(c_1,c_2)$, where $c_1,c_2\in\mathbb{R}$.

\bigskip

In this setting the frequency domain is divided in specific areas distributed in two high-frequency cones and one low-frequency squared section; the horizontal cone is covered by elements $\psi_{a,s,t}(x)=a^{-3/4}\psi(S_sA_ax-M_ct)$, similarly the vertical cone is covered by elements of the form $\tilde{\psi}_{a,s,t}$, and finally the low-frequency section covered by a low pass filter elements of the form $\phi_t = \phi(x-c_1t)$. As well as the classical shearlets, the cone-adapted shearlets form a frame of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ under some conditions on the generating functions; the big difference between this two systems is that the later have a more optimal tiling of the frequency domain. 

\bigskip

\label{fig:Cones}
\end{figure}

As we already mentioned at the beginning of the section, the space associated to the sinogram of a function can be represented by the space 

$$
\begin{aligned}
L^2_{2\pi-x_1}([0,2\pi)\times\mathbb{R}):= \{ f:[0,2\pi)\times\mathbb{R}\longrightarrow \mathbb{R} &\bigg| \int_{[0,2\pi)\times\mathbb{R}}|f(x_1,x_2)|^2dx_1dx_2<\infty, \\
& f(x_1,x_2)=f(x_1+2\pi,x_2)\forall (x_1,x_2)\in [0,2\pi)\times\mathbb{R} \}
\end{aligned}
$$

We would like to construct a shearlet system that forms a frame for this space.
